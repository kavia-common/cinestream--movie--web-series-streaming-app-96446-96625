# React/.env example for CineStream Frontend
# Rename this file to ".env" and adjust values for your environment.

# Preferred: Base URL of the backend API (without trailing slash)
# Example: http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Also supported as fallbacks by the client (if REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL is not set):
# BACKEND_URL and PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL can be used in environments where variables
# are injected without the CRA "REACT_APP_" prefix.
BACKEND_URL=https://vscode-internal-19871-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001
PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://vscode-internal-19871-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001

# Notes:
# - Do NOT include a trailing slash.
# - Do NOT include "/docs" or "/openapi.json" â€” use only the API root.
# - If none of these variables are set, the app falls back to "/api" which requires
#   a development proxy to be configured to forward /api -> backend.
